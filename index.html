"The tale of a sick dragon"
</P>
Once, before the existence of cities, there were two <a href = https://look.com.ua/pic/201401/1600x1200/look.com.ua-89961.jpg >fire dragons </a>, living in the caves of the volcano, where the heat could burn firewood, they lived a quiet, worldly life, because they were a friendly and close couple, helped each other, protected themselves from aggressive tribes, hunted and ate together, they had no hardships and problems. But once, on a stormy night, when the rain was so heavy that it could flood several plains, an old man, the father of all races – <a href = https://m1.35photo.pro/photos_temp/sizes/415/2078644_1000n.jpg >Anerod</a>, came to them and asked them to stay with them until the downpour subsides, the dragons looked at each other and after a little discussion agreed. He lived with them for a long time, a few days, or even weeks, the dragons fed him, and he modestly ate a small piece of meat, no larger than his fist, and did not ask for more, the dragons were surprised at his modesty, asked him to eat more, because he might die of hunger, but the old man thanked them, and did not take more than he wanted. When the downpour ended, in gratitude to the dragons, he predicted the coming event – " Strong children will Come to you, they will become the guardians of many empires, and they will live for a long time, but only one of them will survive them and the whole world. But it will be different from them. And if you accept him as your children, all will live to the end of time, if not, then only he, and the rest will kill, for their sins and pride." And Anerod went on his way, and the dragons continued to live a worldly life.
</P>
After a hundred years, their children were born from eggs, all red and orange, like fire, all playful and active, just hatched, and already want to burn everything around. But there was one strange one among them, very different from them: white as snow, with dark blue eyes that looked like a deep sea bottom, and he had no legs, but he was bigger than the others, and his wings were huge, but as soon as he hatched, he smelled them all and lay down under the wing and belly of his mother. Everyone was horrified, for the dragon was so different that it could not be believed that he could be the greatest dragon. His mother and father took him in, and began to feed him, just like everyone else. Later time, grown-up dragons, began to fly, but White Dragon, not began fly, he continued sleep have mothers under wing, hasn't waking up and though far, about than something reflecting. Many of his brothers began to consider him weak, and useless, not playing-sleeping, not flying-looking into the distance. For a long time, everyone grew and became stronger, except for the white dragon, which changed its color to blue-blue with purple shimmering, and among the fire dragons appeared the strongest and proudest-<a href = https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/max_808/6d5f1d60219357.Y3JvcCwxNTM3LDEyMDMsMTMyLDA.jpg >Wangarad </a>, his body was red like blood, and his belly was like flames, his horns were the shape of mammoth tusks, frightening everyone, and his eyes were like sparks of a fire burning at home. He began to openly despise the White Dragon, began to burn it with his flame, bite it, and using his claws inflicted wounds on it, his father demanded to stop it, then Wangarad did not listen to him, and continued this action. But after a while, a small white ball, moved away from sleep, and stretched out at full length surprised everyone with its size, for it was larger than all its brothers, and its wings were larger than his father's. And he flew, on his first flight, looking at the jungle and what was under its leaves. And only in the evening returned, but again lay down under the wing of his mother. Vanguard was angry, that he was more of it, and flew it longer than him. And he decided to take revenge on him for this disgrace.
</P>
At night, he stealthily led the White Dragon from under the mother's wing, and stealthily flew with it to distant lands where it is so cold that even the fire dragon can only survive for a week. And when he arrived there, he put it down, and brutally began to beat, cut and bite it, the White dragon woke up and a fight began, where everyone bit each other to survive, but still Wangarad came out victorious, injuring the White dragon so that it ceased to be WHITE. ‘Now you look like a fire dragon, but you will no longer disgrace our family, and me, now you will die here as a worthless weakling, useless to anyone! ’ Said Wangard, and flew back. Leaving his brother to fend for himself. But in the end, Vangaral heard: "Now you forever lost for themselves brothers, parents, and forever will remain weak, for you chose path self-destruction, and you now not wind back, you closed for themselves a path righteous a dragon, you wallowed in darkness sins and temptations, you regulation killed themselves a, and finally you will fall asleep eternal nightmare,for soul your will, tormented forever in world
Vanguard not taken the words seriously and continued to fly home, simultaneously hiding their wounds and the blood on the body and claws. The next morning, the parents were in shock, and desperately searched for that dragon, but could not find it, and they began to grieve, but the father stared menacingly at all the children, and asked: ‘and which of you did this? I know that only one of you could have done this, but I want you to confess what you did, because I don't want to lose you’. There was no answer, some looked at each other, and Vanguard all continued quietly to observe what is happening. But suddenly his father looked at him with a penetrating look of true anger. Vangarad looked worried, but didn't show it. His father, with a quick movement of his tail, seized him by the neck and threw him to the ground, saying: "You! Ungrateful Son, why did you do this?! What for?! And don't Think I'm stupid, I know that only you could do it! Only YOU – Vangard! ’ Wangard said, ‘I couldn't stand it weak and insignificant, the patient dragon! He didn't even spew flames and had no legs, only wings, he's a disgrace to our family! ’ After these words, the father threw it into another part of the wall and spewing flames-burned it. ‘Because of you, you will all die! Fool! Only YOU are the shame of our family! The FRATRICIDE! "- after these words, the Father and Mother flew away in search of their son. The rest of the boys stayed with Wangaratta, considering that he did the right thing. And after a few hundred years, all the sons became guardians of empires that honored and respected them. But Wangarad felt a strange feeling, a feeling that something was missing, and he realized that he needed more land for his Empire! And the war of the brothers for dominion over the world began.
</P>
Meanwhile, the White Dragon still lived and lived on the ice land, and he could not fly, because his wings were so badly injured that it was difficult to call them wings, he ate carrion, and ate with difficulty. But once I saw a city among the permafrost. And he went to it, and when he reached it and saw the faces of the inhabitants who were afraid of him, he lay down at the gate and fell asleep. The residents were confused as to what to do with it. They went out and found him sleeping in a lump. They examined him, and saw that he was so emaciated that his bones were visible, and his wings were cut so that a man could pass through them, and the chief told them to feed, drink, and heal him, for dragons, sacred animals, must be honored and respected. After 6 long years, the White dragon finally woke up and realized that it was completely healed. And the chief asked him, " Who crippled you like this? What kind of dragon are you? I've never seen anything like it! "The dragon told him his story from beginning to end.
</P>
And the chief with a smile on his face said: "we are Brothers in misfortune, we were deprived of the guardian, and our Holy lands were conquered because of this, so let's you become our guardian, and we will honor you’"
</P>
The dragon agreed, and after a while, was able to spew an icy flame that freezes everything it touches. And in one moment, he United all his worshippers and, as the horseman of the Apocalypse, started wars with those who turned him into an outcast, those who made his worshippers weak, exhausted, and insulted! And he fought with all of them cruelly and mercilessly, many of his brothers he killed, and some of the griffins had to be killed... for their great sins, and finally he found Vangarad-the root of his loneliness, misery and grief. And the battle began a long 7 days where ice and fire, light and darkness, Truth and Lies, fought for their ideals, but still Wangarad was defeated, and turned into ice, and then killed by a White Dragon, and from that moment It was called Karma-Serpent. And he became the only dragon-Keeper of the Empire, which to this day lives under his command, and the dragon continues to search for their parents, hoping at least to see them.
</P>
This story can be considered a Bylina that tells about the mentality of the Ihmer people. The dragon actually means their special, unique culture and religion, which has developed and survived despite assimilation by hostile magical empires that could completely destroy this nation.
